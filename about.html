            <p class="content">
                We strive to evolve our products based on the feedback we receive from our consumers. In each game,
                there is a poll allowing those who play our games to provide us with feedback based on their experience
                to better ensure that future versions of the game meet our players' expectations.

            <h1 class="h1-content">Our Values</h1>
            <p class="content">
                MentalPlay allows our employees to feel as if their work has meaning. Our associates have a passion for
                educating people about an issue that all humankind will experience at some point in their life, as well
                as themselves as they perform their different roles in the production of our games. We also seek to
                bring inspiration into our customers' homes and lives that there is an answer to the mental battle they
                are facing and that there is someone who cares. We pride ourselves on compassion and empathy.

                MentalPlay thrives on defining our success upon our customers' experiences with our products. If our
                purchasers are not happy with our products or their expectations have not been met, we have not
                succeeded as a company. MentalPlay is solely focused on making sure that our products bring you, your
                friends, and your family closer together, and being able to enjoy learning about mental health.
                TOGETHER.

                Beyond our games, we are committed to making a tangible impact on mental health awareness globally. Our
                initiatives include organizing mental health awareness campaigns, collaborating with mental health
                professionals to offer support, and providing resources for those in need. We aim to create a world
                where mental health is openly discussed and where individuals have access to the help they need.
