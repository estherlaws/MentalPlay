                Mental health issues affect millions of people worldwide. The stigma and lack of awareness around mental
                health lead to suffering in silence. At MentalPlay, we are dedicated to changing this narrative by
                creating engaging educational tools that raise awareness and provide support.

                While our games serve as an entry point for mental health education, our solution extends beyond the
                digital realm. We offer workshops, seminars, and community outreach programs designed to foster
                understanding and provide practical tools for managing mental health.
